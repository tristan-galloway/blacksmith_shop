# Overview

For this project, my idea is to emulate a lot of the in game shops in a simple way.
I plan on trying to recreate a in game shop, for right now I want to handle
the backend logic with a simple menu to make sure it's working properly.

# Future Work

- Modify Remove and Add to be Buy and Sell respectively.
- Integrate some sort of cloud storage to hold the items in the shop.
